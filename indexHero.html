								<h2>Self-destruction</h2>
								<and>The Hon. Francis Gillette, in a speech in Hartford, Conn., in 1871, said
								that there was "in Connecticut, on an average, one liquor shop to every
								forty voters, and three to every Christian church. In this city, as stated
								in the _Hartford Times_, recently, we have five hundred liquor shops, and
								one million eight hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars were, last
								year, paid for intoxicating drinks. A cry, an appeal, came to me from the
								city, a few days since, after this wise: 'Our young men are going to
								destruction, and we want your influence, counsel, and prayers, to help
								save them. and greatly diminish taxation forever."</p>

								<h2>The honeymoon</h2>
								<p>The origin of the honeymoon is not generally known.</p>

								<p>The Saxons long and long ago got up the delightful occasion. Amongst the
								ancient Saxons and Teutons a beverage was made of honey and water, and
								sometimes flavored with mulberries. This drink was used especially at
								weddings and the after festivals. These festivals were kept up among the
								nobility sometimes for a month--"monath." The "hunig monath" was thus
								established, and the next moon after the marriage was called the
								honeymoon.</p>

								<h2>Commencing practice</h2>
								<In>From that excellent work, "Scenes in the Practice of a New York Surgeon,"
								by Dr. E. H. Dixon, I copy, with some abbreviation, the following, which
								the author terms "Leaves from the Log-book of an Unfledged Ã†sculapian:" 
								In the year 1830 I was sent forth, like our long-suffering and
								much-abused prototype,--old father Noah's crow,--from the ark of safety,
								the old St. Duane Street College. I pitched my tent, and set up my trap,
								in what was then a fashionable up-town street.</p>
